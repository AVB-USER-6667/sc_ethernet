Configuration Defines
---------------------

The file ethernet_conf.h must be provided in the application source
code. This file can set the following defines:

**MAX_ETHERNET_PACKET_SIZE**

    This define sets the largest packet size in bytes that the ethernet mac
    will receive. The default it the largest possible ethernet packet
    size (1518 bytes). Setting this to a smaller value will save
    memory but restrict the type of packets you can receieve.

**NUM_MII_RX_BUF**

    Number of incoming packets that will be buffered within the MAC.

**NUM_MII_TX_BUF**

    Number of outgoing packets that will be buffered within the MAC.

**MAX_ETHERNET_CLIENTS**

    The maximum number of clients that can be connected to the
    :c:func:`ethernet_server` function via the rx and tx channel arrays.

Custom Filter Function
----------------------

Every application is required to provide this function. It also needs
to be prototyped (or defined as an inline definition) in the header
file ``mac_custom_filter.h``.

.. c:function:: int mac_custom_filter(unsigned int data[])

   This function examines an ethernet packet and returns a filter
   number to allow different clients to obtain different types of packet.
   The function *must* run within 6us to allow 100Mbit filtering of
   packets.

   :param data: This array contains the ethernet packet. It does not 
                include the preamble but does include the layer 2
                header or the packet.

   :returns: 0 if the packet is not wanted by the application or        
             a number that can be registed by
             :c:func:`mac_set_custom_filter` by a client. Clients 
             register a mask so the number is usually made up of a 
             bit per unique client destination for the packet.
